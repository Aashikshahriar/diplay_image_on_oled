# diplay_image_on_oled
Here I written a python code for converting any image to bitmap image of the size of display. then you need to copy the hex codes from the text file generated. and putt this to the arduino code on necessary place.
Place the image on the same directory of the code you writting using any IDE.
Some of use SH1106 1.3 inch oled display. You need to download the library for it from arduino ide's library manager.
